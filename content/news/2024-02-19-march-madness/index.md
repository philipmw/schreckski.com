Hi XC skiers, 

Now that we are assured of a good snow pack and excellent grooming through the end of March, I am now booking Lessons for Classic or Skate skiing in This March Madness month.

 Only in the Month of March, I'm booking all lessons as a March Madness 25% longer lessons as the conditions are so nice. Bring sunglasses and don't over dress!

If you are interested in  lessons, this is a great time to ski and refine your technique. Here's some options for a one hour lesson for one or two students.  The last slot each day can also be a 2 hour lesson.  

Only In March, all lessons are extended 25%!  So a one hour lesson slot is 75 minutes.  A 2 hour lesson is now 2.5 hours for March at my usual hourly Website prices:

To reserve your preferred dates,  just Venmo me at my account. The link is on my Website Schreckski.com and let me know your date and time in the notes or email me back if you have any questions.  Schreckski@gmail.com 

One of favorite ways to teach beginning skiers to XC Skate or Classic push-off is to imagine that you are catching a basketball üèÄ and then throw the üèÄ off one boot and slide on the other boot. So when you're following College Basketball (or watching XC World Cup skiers) this month, practice skiing by catching and throwing your üèÄ
 In socks on a hardwood is even better sliding!

So let's XC SKI if we can't bike!
