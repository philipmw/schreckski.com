Hi XC skiers,

 This article is from Cross Country Skier magazine, December 2022.  It discusses taking XC Skate or Classic lessons and why finding a good certified instructor may improve your experience.

 I have taught XC skiing (once known as Nordic) full-time for 10 seasons, since 2013.  I joined PSIA (Professional Ski Instructors of America) for the coaching on how to teach XC Skate and Classic ski techniques effectively in 2014.  

In 2015, I passed my PSIA Level 1 exams.  In 2018, I passed my Level 2 exams, a full two day on snow skiing test on teaching intermediate Classic and Skate students.  

So the most important skill I have worked on for over 10 years is how to observe an XC skier and find the one or two areas that if we work on improving, the skier finds they are skiing with more efficient technique and so their skiing feels more effortless.

 In December, before I taught 3 days at the largest XC Ski Camp in the NW, (the Methow Valley Ski Camp) I practiced at an advanced level ski clinic led by the PSIA National Demo Coach, Tulie.  Next Sunday, I will attend an all day advanced PSIA instructor clinic with her again to stay up to date on the latest, best way to teach you!

So just like you take lessons to improve your XC Skiing skills, I believe XC ski instructor clinics are so helpful for me to get the most enjoyment out of XC skiing and improve upon teaching you.  I love teaching and am passionate about transferring my Skate and Classic XC ski skills to my students.  The Dad jokes are no charge.

 I hope you enjoy YOUR XC Skiing journey with me.

let's bike if we can't ski!
