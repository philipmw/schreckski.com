Hi Skiers,

Bad news, the ski season is half over. Good news the second half is the best half! Here's my top 10 reasons why:

10. By February we have our peak snowpack. Great coverage!

9. You should be in peak ski shape right? Great conditioning, perfect balance, & you've dialed in your XC ski technique by now.

8. If not quite there, see my new openings that just came available for a tune-up lesson in

16th  8:30
17th  8:30 on a Friday!
19th 8:30 on a Sunday!
20th 8:30, 10am on a Holiday!

7. Notice it's light earlier?

6. Notice the better weather?
 More bluebird less blah!

5. It's colder so the grooming is awesome. 

4.  It's almost Spring Skiing. My favorite time to ski fast.

3.  Weather still sucks in Seattle.  Sunnier up here on the Dry Side. 

2. Still rains in Seattle when we get broken clouds and partly sunny up here in the mountains. 

And the number one reason, drum roll please:

1.  This time of year, Seattle-ites start to think about... golf.  Or gardening or a number of dumb things to do instead of ski.  So it's less crowded!

let's bike if we can't ski!
