Hi fellow XC skiers,

Doesn't it feels like Fall? 
And with snow up higher, its almost Winter! 
So Are your skis ready? 

Ideally, you hot waxed them after your last day Spring Skiing to protect them from the Summer heat and dryness in your garage; and you are waxing them off soon, now that it's nice humidity and cold in your garage. 

If you want your skis to have a "Spa day" at my garage or if you want to learn how to hot wax your skis, plan a trip up here to beautiful Roslyn Ridge where my wax shop/wax clinic and Bike garage is located! Just let me know when is a good time for you.

XC Skis at my ski shop are first brushed clean and inspected for dings. If needed, I can work on improving your bases. Next they get Swix 8 Hot wax for our most common conditions up at Snoqualmie Pass Sno Parks.  And then it's off to the "sauna room", my hot box to keep the wax softer longer for better impregnated wax deep in your bases. Then wax off and go, after a glass of üç∑ ü•Ç, of course! See photos of their "sauna" room and the "massage" table where the magic happens!

While I have only been a certified PSIA (Professional Ski Instructors of America) XC ski Pro for 11 years, I have been a certified Wax Technician for 40 years now! I have been fortunate to also learn from some of the best XC wax techs in the USA and Canada.  

So let's XC SKI if we can't bike!

"The Road goes ever on and on,
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say."
