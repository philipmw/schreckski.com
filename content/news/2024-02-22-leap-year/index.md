Hi Skiers,

Ok, you get an extra day to ski this year and Mother Nature is bringing us a big old fashioned Spring Snowstorm this Sunday and Monday.  NOAA is forecasting 7 to 11 inches for each day up here at the I-90 Corridor.  I am confident we will have plenty of base to ski until they stop grooming April 1st.  No fooling!

So if you're looking to become more efficient or faster on your XC skis, March is an excellent month to XC ski and take a tune-up lesson.  I didn't book lessons for March until recently once we were assured of excellent conditions.  

Email me with your wish list of dates. I have a March Madness deal for you. All lessons are 25% longer in March. Book a 1 hour lesson and its 1:15. Book a two hour and its 2.5 hours. Book a three hour and its 3 hours & 45 minutes! 

  No fooling!

So let's XC SKI if we can't bike!

Schreck (Mike)
