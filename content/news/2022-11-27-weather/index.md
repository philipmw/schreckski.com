Hi XC skiers,

If you are heading up to the Methow Valley Ski Camp December 15-18th, I will be teaching up there again this year.  Ask for me for one or more of your ski lessons. I just got back from skiing there for 5 sessions before Thanksgiving.  Great grooming and excellent snowpack for this time of the year! See photos below, and yes, I am the tallest skier! :)

let's bike if we can't ski!
