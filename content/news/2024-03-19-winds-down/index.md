Hi Happy XC skiers,

It's all peaches and cream, skiing on groomed snow; until April Fools Day rolls around here in Washington, and there's no more grooming for our beloved sport. How do you keep your hard earned ski legs? Your ski fitness? Your balance on one ski skill?

I personally spend a good part of April XC skiing at Mt Bachelor Nordic Center (6,000' elevation so lots of snow).  They have a Spring Pass: April 1st to about June usually. But I do need to get in gravel racing shape so only skiing in the mornings.  Afternoon is for gravel biking, my other ‚ù§Ô∏è üòç 

No worries, you don't have to travel or buy expensive rollerskis (that's another Schreckski newsletter.) You don't need to join a gym (although if you already have, then use it with these drills below!) 

If you are serious about this,  a few things can turn your hallway like mine. It's inexpensive and easy to use because you see it every time you walk down the Hall! 
My setup:

1. A chin up bar. Crucial for your double pole and skate poling technique.  If it has multiple positions and elbow straps, so much more fun!

2. Two pull down rubber cords with ski pole handles. Mimics XC double poling, diagonal poling, V2, V1, V2A etc. Text if you have any questions or want to see my setup. 

3. A balance ball. Mine's a Bosu 1/2 ball. Text me for photos. 

4. A plank board. Mine is Stealth and has games on an App to keep you occupied and motivated to keep on it! See photos by texting me.

5. Barbells. Mine can adjust as I get stronger or weaker. Not a crucial feature though. 

6. A wall to do chair sits, forward leans, etc. It's free!

7. Get outside and have fun doing what you most like to do! Hike with longish trekking poles; ski bounding is a more vigorous way to add cardio and balance, especially uphill on trails. 

Bike, run, SUP, kayak, row, Rollerblade, rollerskate, etc., whatever you love to do! 

If you find yourself recreating near Roslyn, just text me and we can gravel bike, Rollerski, or ski bound!

So let's bike if we can't XC ski!
