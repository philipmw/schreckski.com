Hi Skiers,

This is the most common question I get daily! Sometimes I am already up here skiing so I know (at least for the sno Park that I am skiing!)

No one likes this answer but it depends and you'll know after you ski. Please bring both your skate and classic skis up here.

Here's the best response to this difficult question.  Just know that the weather at Snoqualmie Pass rarely matches the weather at Cabin Creek,  Crystal Springs and even Hyak! Last I checked, no one XC skis at the Pass.

Here's why from CCWRC.ORG:

> "Predicting snow conditions…Will the snow be hard, soft, wet, dry, slow, fast, the consistency of mashed potatoes or cascade cement?!  It seems like we should be able to look at the forecast and get a good read on what the snow conditions will be like along the I-90 corridor.  We can look at the temperatures on the Kongsberger website, we can read the grooming reports, and we can get almost real-time reports via the CCWRC Facebook Page.  But if you really want to know what the conditions are you just have to go up there and put your skis on the snow.

> There are many factors that affect the snow conditions: was it below or above freezing the previous night, did it get above freezing during the day, a north facing slope could be solid ice on a day with above freezing temperatures, the trail could be soft in the sun and then icy in the shaded areas.  There are a myriad of microclimates in the area.  One particularly interesting feature is when cold air flows from east to west through the pass and keeps the freezing level at the surface, even when the forecast is for the freezing level to be above 3000 feet.  This typically happens when there is high pressure in eastern Washington and low pressure on the west side.

> Be prepared to be surprised at the conditions and be prepared to change your plans (classic vs skate vs snowshoe).  More often that not I find the conditions to be better than forecast even when they are predicting rain.
> The bottom line: the grooming can only be done while there is snow.  Get it while it’s here.  If you hesitate…the opportunity may melt away :)"

I find that 95% of the time, the conditions are different from the day before; 99% of the time you can ski virtually anything. I ski 7 days a week regardless of conditions.  I admit a thick sheet of ice from freezing rain at sub zero temperatures was a new challenge,  but if it was perfectly groomed every time, well then it's called bowling!

Rain rarely ruins skiing, it just keeps the crowds away and can be snotty fast! So if you know someone who is interested in an XC Skiing lesson,  thanks for sharing my Website: <https://schreckski.com>

let's ski if we can't bike!
