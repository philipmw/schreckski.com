Hi Classic XC skiers,

I know some of you may already have reviewed Andy Newell's excellent drill to take your Classic Diagonal stride to the next level with his new video. I highly recommend viewing and then practicing these drills in your next Classic technique session or lesson. 

As Andy mentions, "The terrain is critical to your success!" Choose "P2C TRAIL" terrain first for the early drills.  Then take your classic Diagonal stride to a short hill that levels off (the sled trails above P2C  for example.) 
I can help you become more efficient on your classic skis if you want a tune-up.  I have some ideas to help you!

Note that they probably have taken good care of the kick and glide sections of their classic skis. I suggest you hot wax the tips and tails and prep your skins before trying this session. 

Also, The snow has been very abrasive and dirty with the polar vortex and lack of new snow for this past week or so.  About 50 miles is all you can expect from your hot wax and your skins need to be cleaned and prepped at least every 3rd session and ideally daily! I can help if you need it.
