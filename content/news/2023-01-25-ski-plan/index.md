Hi XC Skiers,

Sarah N. Asked me a question about if I attached a lesson plan to her email before her first lesson. If you have had lessons before with Schreckski,  you can guess my answer but some of you have your first lesson coming up so here's my answer:
‐---------------------------
Hi Sarah,
Your lesson plan is based on where you are in you ski journey,  what you want to accomplish in skiing and based on observing you ski.  Every lesson is customized to you! 

No cookie cutter plan.  Each lesson builds on your progress.  No two skiers have the same experience, Physiology or needs. That's what I mean by a custom plan. We build it based on you!

See you tomorrow! Rest up, stretch maybe and be prepared to ski more efficiently in just four lessons (ok and some practice.)
‐---------------------------------------------
I also want to give apologies in advance for my tiny company.  It's just me.  I am not a corporation. Yes my daughter Annie helps with my YouTube Channel and IG and my son Jim produces my cool stickers and business cards.  And without Philip, my ski friend, I wouldn't know how to set up my website: Schreckski.com. 

But I don't have a secretary and I teach all morning and ski afterwards.  I am trying to answer your texts/emails requests or questions and lesson changes/requests usually on freezing ski trails with numb fingers on my old small cellphone and my permanent (paper!) calendar is back in my cozy cabin. So if I mispeak and need to modify your lesson time, that's why.

So bear with me. I taught 82 students just in December.  January is always been my biggest month. 123 students are scheduled for a lesson in January!  I am trying to accommodate changes to your schedule and I tell many students my current availability.  But someone else may Venmo me before you so my availability is fluid and ever changing.  Also, you, my current students, get preference before any new skiers.  I want your experience to be exceptional.  For your future tune up or 4 pack lessons,  setting them up as early as possible guarantees you your favorite dates. The new to me students that I cannot accommodate very well ask me for a lesson now or tomorrow! 

With that said, thank you for letting me be a part of your XC Skiing journey!

Thanks, now go XC ski!

let's bike if we can't ski!
