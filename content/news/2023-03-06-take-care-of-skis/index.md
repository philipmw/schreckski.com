Hi Skiers,

I have been getting questions about waxing your XC skis.  If you are just renting or already knowledgeable on waxing prep,  then you can skip. But if you want take care of your investment and ski more efficiently and not get sticking skis, read on!

‚Äê--------------------------

For Skate (entire ski) or Classic (tips and tails), the glide zone can be improved with hot (or a daily liquid) wax. Your skis will glide further and it protects the life of your bases. Also protects you from icing up and then snow clumping on the ice.

Hot wax gets into the bases and sticks around for about 50 (dirty snow) to 100 miles (clean snow)

If you don't have the tools to hot wax your own skis, the REI rolling hot wax $10 (or free to members) is a great option. Do this at least once a season or every 50-100 miles of skiing whichever comes first.

I also would have handy a Swix F4 liquid wax with an applicator side to rub on let dry, then use the felt on bottom to rub in nicely.
I Would do this between ski days if not Hot waxing regularly. If you have fish scales for grip, I would do the same there but less frequently, maybe every three days. This keeps your fishscales from getting dry and icing up. 

Clean and prep the mohair if you have classic skin skis.  Swix makes both in a box with a spray bottle and they come with the lint free cloth. I recommend you do this between skis or maybe get by every other ski day. 

A little preparation on your skate and classic skis can make a difference in your efficiency and quality of your XC Skiing! 

let's bike if we can't ski!
