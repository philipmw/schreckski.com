Hi Skiers,

Thus is just a suggestion and you may or may not agree with it.  As some of you know, I believe in preventing accidents, falls and especially concussions.  Most of my concussions have occurred biking on ice and snow. Some from skiing too fast downhill.  Helmets are required safety for Alpine and backcountry skiing, mountaineering and of course biking.  I was required by my doctor to wear a bike helmet for 30 days while skiing due to a really bad concussion. I am still called "helmet boy" and it was 2 years ago!

Philip White shared a product that is not going to replace your bike helmet but still give some protection on snow. It's much more protective than a regular ski hat!

I ordered the winter version.  You'll see it on me going forward!

let's bike if we can't ski!
