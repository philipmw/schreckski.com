Hi skiers,

If you don't have a suitable ski dog, then delete. But if you're skijoring curious, this is the best introduction to the great sport! I found it in this morning's Seattle Times newspaper. And if you have a free dog and the harness, I want to talk with you about borrowing your dog for an outing at Crystal Springs!


The Nordic sport of skijoring brings four-legged friends into the fold for a day of cross-country skiing. Here's what you need to know to give the sport a try.
