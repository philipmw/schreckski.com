Welcome to a great 2023 XC ski year! 

After a lot of huge snowstorms, "chains required" and "I-90 closed for avy control" in "Stormcember", we are coming into a "Dry January" (weather not alcohol) with the largest snowpack I've ever seen.

 So what does that mean for you? With cold dry days forecasted for the near future, we are predicted to have excellent ski conditions  in January and a snow base for a long XC ski season until April 1st! 

 Due to the "Covid effect" on increased XC Sno Park passes purchased last year, we are getting more $ for grooming this season.  There are more places being groomed more days a week than I have ever seen up here. Great time to be a cross country skier. 

Yes parking is tighter than ever at Hyak and Cabin Creek Sno Parks.  That's why Crystal Springs is our little secret (Pray don't tell!)
Crystal Springs Sno park Parking lot  is so big you can see it from outer space!  And it's never full; even on Holidays like yesterday when it was fully packed and impossible at both Cabin Creek and Hyak Sno Parks (unless, of course, you arrived early.) I have elves at all the Sno Parks giving me intel.

I still have a few openings in January on Mondays (beginning skiers at Hyak) & Wednesday and Thursday mornings (all types of teaching terrain at Crystal Springs). So get these skis waxed and get up here while the skiing is awesome!

let's XC ski if we can't SNOW bike!
