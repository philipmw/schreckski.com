Hi tired XC skiers,

I predict that indeed this will be the longest continuous XC ski season ever for the Snoqualmie Pass Area.  Period end of story & incredible.  The only way we can't make it to March 31st is if the Sno Parks run out of grooming funds. We would still have plenty of snow to Classic ski just no grooming into April. 

 Winter has been super fantastic these last three weeks with very cold weather, some nice snow fall and no temperatures above freezing.  And so, unlike most years, we are still building up our snowpack from Hyak to Crystal Springs through February.  March should be a great month to XC ski! Usually we start to get more sun, less storms and fewer crowded trails! 

So to answer a common question,  yes I am teaching all March and it should be delightful!  In early April, I am at the Spring Clinic at Mt Bachelor Nordic Center near Bend. Come join me if interested in improving your abilities in racing or just going fast!

XC ski Racers lead you on a fast ski and video tape your skate and classic skiing.  You must be high end intermediate to Expert Skier and fit enough to keep up. You also need to apply and they sell out. The dates are April  6-9. You can choose one or all 4.  J.D. is the former XC Tech Coach for the USA XC Ski team.  He is an exceptional coach who critiques your videos.

 Afternoons are for biking, land drills and watching his analysis on a Zoom meeting.  If interested let me know if you want the link. If I agree with your assessment of your XC ski speed, you can give J.D. my reference as I have been to his Camp multiple years.  

There's usually a 7 day Fall Camp as well. It conflicts with the Methow Valley Ski Camp this December and I will be teaching there (I sure hope again!) It is for all adults, is 75% female, all abilities and you should have both Classic and Skate down or at least willing to try in a beginner class. It is phenomenal.  2nd weekend in December; usually sells out in 1 to 4 hours.

Finally if you're still interested in a lesson,  here's what I have available for you!
