Hi Skiers,

Hopefully you have enjoyed some of the best weather and new snow this past week skiing your heart out, wearing your sunglasses and enjoying the perfect grooming. (I picked up new skis on Monday at Winthrop and talk about depressing. No snow in the Methow!) But It's like mid winter up here at Crystal Springs except more ðŸŒž!

March Madness continues and I was asked to update my availability for your Spring tune-up lessons.  All 1 hour lessons are 75 minutes,  2 hour are 2.5 hours; so you get 25% more Teaching for the same price! 

You are at your peak ski fitness. Set your next ski season up by letting me help you be more efficient on your skis. Check out the 31st if you want to ski on the last grooming of the season!
