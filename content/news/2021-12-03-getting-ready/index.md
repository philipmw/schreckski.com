Hi fellow and curious bikers and skiers,

30° this am at the Schreckski cabin and a hard frost on the roofs with snow in the forecast. As we transition from one season, i.e. the bike season to the snow season,  I hope you are getting psyched to XC ski!

Some things you can be doing while we Wait for the ❄ on the I-90 Corridor:

1. Get in your cardio workouts any way you can! I mostly bike with studded snow tires and use poles to ski bound up the Cle Elum Ridge.  Use your Indoor bike trainer, treadmill, ski erg or any other tool that gets your heart pumped up; this will make the transition to snow easier and more efficient. And more fun!

2. Some balance work is key and can be fitted into a short period of your workout. Bosu balance ball or bounding from one leg to the other, (weights optional) are an important factor in balancing on a flat ski. If you have rollerskis, focus more on the various techniques. Also I recommend you ski/balance from one leg to the other when you dry off and brush your teeth.

3. Weight or body bearing workouts will help you be strong instead of sore on your first days skiing.  I use pull down straps, chin up bar, and mostly my body weight like chair sits on a wall, push-ups, etc.

4. Our core is the key to effortless XC Skiing. All of your key propulsion muscles in your quads, arms and upper back are connected to your strong stable core. Planks, crunches, arm hangs with knees up will make your base, the core stronger.

5. Prepare your skis. Schreckski.com can help if you don't have or want the waxing tools.

6. Pick a date! After 3 lessons, your 4th lesson is on me. A 4 lesson program will make a big difference in your skills and technique.
