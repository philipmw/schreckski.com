Hi to my XC ski friends, 

I hope you are living life large and enjoying our incredible weather to be outside this Summer. üåû 

I Know it's hard to think about the upcoming ski season when it's warm ‚òÄÔ∏è and the skiing ‚õ∑Ô∏è on snow is a distant memory. Before you know it though, the days will get cold ü•∂ and the snow ‚ùÑÔ∏è will return to our beautiful groomed I-90 Sno Parks!

One ski question I get this time of year is: 
"Schreck, how do I be ready when that first XC ski day comes along?"  
First get out and do what sport makes you breathe hard, is the most comfortable for you, and takes you to your happy place: Bike, Run, SUP, Hike, Rollerski, Rollerblade, Surf, swim, etc.  I find, personally, that it doesn't really matter which sport I choose as long as I'm having fun. 

I believe: As long as you are getting your heart and major muscles working, balancing, especially on one leg to the other leg, and enjoying the experience, you are getting prepared for day one on your XC skis! You might also get some hot wax or even liquid wax on your ski bases. Just leave it on until just before ski season starts when you then scrape or buff the wax off.

I had to make some changes to my website: Schreckski.com . Please check it out if you're looking for a tune-up in December. My Commercial Use Permit, PSIA certification and ski instructor insurance has increased my expenses.  I try to give you, my friends, my best and the fourth lesson is still on me! Pre-pay for three and get four weekly tune-up lessons for you or someone special.  

If there is a specific day of the week or time slot, please let me know. And a lesson with Schreck makes a unique and possibly a transforming Christmas gift!

Last season was crazy busy and I want to focus on you, my friends, and your family and your friends who want to love winter by XC skiing more efficiently! 

Let me know if you have any questions and I hope to see you out skiing this coming ski  season.  I also plan on teaching in early December at the Methow Valley Ski Camp again.  What A wonderful way to jump start your season.

I leave tomorrow morning on a short bikepacking trip in the mountains with no cell service so I won't be as prompt to respond to emails this week.  I will back this coming weekend. The photos below are from my Tour de California: a little hilly ride looping a very beautiful state: 2,200 miles in 49 days with 127,000 ft of climbing. Fun!

So let's bike if we can't ski!
