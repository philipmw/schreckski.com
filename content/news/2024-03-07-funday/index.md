Hi Saturday XC Skiers, 

The new snow and cold sunny weather has set us up for a great day of skiing on Saturday! Be prepared for a little colder weather and bring your sunglasses. 

AM skaters, we're at the Crystal Springs SnoParks on this Saturday as usual. All hour lessons are 25% longer this month! So 75 minutes. So please be on time to get your extra long skate lesson!. 

Try to meet up at the intersection of the P2C Trail and Stampede Pass Trail.  A map with it circled is on my website: Schreckski.com 
Use the 1/2 mile ski up as your warm-up. Here's the schedule:

8:30-9:45  Melsa, #3 lesson on skate, big hills!

10:00-11:15 Damian, skate and Adele, Classic #2 lesson, technique drills.

11:30-12:45. Ilari, skate, first lesson,  well see where you are skating and go from there.

1:00-1:30 my lunch break

1:30-3:30 Philip (I will bring wax-able Classic skis for you to try) please invite anyone who is interested to join us up top! 

My cellphone number is [...] if you have any questions. 

So let's XC SKI if we can't bike!

Schreck (Mike)
