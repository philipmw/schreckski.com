Hi Skiers, 

First, I've been getting lots of questions about the Snoqualmie I-90 corridor grooming schedule for this coming ski season.  As you recall from last year, it's a fluid answer especially in early season and, if they run low on funds, also in late season.  Always be prepared for any conditions as we are dealing with Mother Nature and the grooming Piston Bullies can break!

I talked with both groomers for both the State Parks: Crystal to Hyak, and Lake Easton and the separate grooming for Cabin Creek and Trollhaugen areas. They are both scheduled to start December 1st as we got about 18 inches in last 24 hours! The first couple days in December could be rough as it takes a few passes and days to firm up the tracks and skate path. I am guessing Saturday, December 3rd should be the first real day to ski. Thursday and Friday could be sketchy. Get these skis Hot Waxed!

Trollhaugen loops:  W, F, SA, SU.
Crystal to Hyak: M, W, TH, F, SA, SU.
Amabilis: W or Th, Sa
Cabin lower: M W, Th, F, Sa, Su
Lake Easton: M, W, F, Sa, Su
Suncadia trails: Only after each snowstorm. No regular grooming schedule 

This is a huge improvement from 10 years ago. Only on Tuesdays is there no grooming. Tuesday has been a good day to Classic ski from Crystal Springs Sno Park to Hyak as it has all night to firm up. Even if it doe snow, skiers keep the tracks open by skiing on them. So it can be a great day to Classic ski! (I only teach Classic at Crystal Springs on Tuesdays for this Reason).

Second,  I have been asked: "So what should I do if I didn't start your recommendation to work out in the previous email?"
So let's start today working on the two areas one needs, our strength and balance on a moving ski, and that can fit into your busy schedule.  

1. Wearing your slippiest socks and on a wood or vinyl floor,  mimic the the skate or Classic motions. Slide and briefly balance on each flat ski with correct arm motion. 5 minutes 

2. Next, up against the wall in the sit on a chair position.  Good dorsiflection (ankles bent closer to top of your feet).  Dynamic up and down motion, about 10 inches like your skiing. Visualize skiing downhill. 5 minutes 

That's it;  in just 10 minutes a day, you will have better balance on one ski AND more lower body strength to ski better!
