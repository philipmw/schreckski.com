Hi Skiers,

If you are interested in skate (bring Classic JIC!) skiing this Tuesday at 8:30 am at Cabin with me, I plan on another Tuesday of first tracks! The Road,  Viking,  Ozbaldy and Berg. Easy skate, no one left behind!
Bring water and nutrition. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

So let's XC SKI if we can't bike!

Schreck (Mike)
