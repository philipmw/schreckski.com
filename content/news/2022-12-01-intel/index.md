Hi Skiers, 

Some photos attached of today's ski track record conditions. 

You may be just as surprised as I am but the FIRST place on our I-90 Corridor with good grooming goes to.....

Suncadia Trails! See photo for proof. I had a wonderful skate and classic sessions today. Blue skies, good base and groomed this morning again after yesterday's grooming of the big dump of snow.

Its BC skiing up at Cabin Creek.  See photo attached and thanks to Rob for sharing. They will probably just pack it down tomorrow so don't go! Not sure when they will plow the parking lot.

The Intel on the P2C Trail is the same, big BC skis are needed as it's been cold blower powder so powder boards are needed to float on top! They may have started cutting downed trees but the Sno Park parking lot is not plowed nor are the Porta potties out.

So here's an idea, I can teach you up here in the sunny, colder Suncadia Trails. Go to (for more info):   Schreckski.com 

Tomorrow's open for lessons, Friday 
10, 11:30, and 1:00.
Same for Sunday the 4th at Suncadia (or Cabin Creek if it's ready to go.)
8:30 and 10 are still available

On Saturday,  December 3rd, I am hoping to teach at Trollhaugen loops and the P2C Trail at Crystal Springs Sno Park 
Available times
8:30 & 11:30

I know getting to Suncadia from Seattle is a longer drive, about 15 minutes longer than driving to Cabin Creek. So come up for the weekend You are close to Cabin and you have Suncadia jic! 
 
There are lots of less expensive Airbnbs here in Roslyn Ridge but if money is no object, The Inn at Suncadia is ski in ski out. They have a nice ski shop and are renting brand new freshly waxed (you knew I would check!)

Meantime, keep up the snow dances! They appear to be working well ❄️ 

Let's ski if we can't bike up here in the mountains,
