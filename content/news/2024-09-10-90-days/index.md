Hi XC skiers,

It seems a ways off but before you know it, we'll be XC skiing again.  I can't wait. 

Now is a good time to prepare for an epic season.  The long term weather forecasters are predicting a strong La Ni≈Ña after our El Nino last season.  That means a greater chance for colder temperatures and more snow!

Here's my to do list to prepare for another great season of XC skiing.

1. Make sure all my skis have their summer wax on. Maybe give them a hotbox treatment while the wax is still on.  This preserves the bases and protects them until it's ski time!

2. Up my cardio. XC skiing puts a big demand on your cardiovascular system; and you are at altitude skiing fast. While you could wait to get in shape on the ski tracks, the weather is perfect to get in some longer sessions on the rollerskis (or skates, blades,etc.),  bikes or running trails (add poles and bound for a more ski specific workout up hills.) 

3. My arms are looking even  skinnier than usual! So time for some upper body workouts on the chin-up pole and pull downs with the rubber bands. If you're like me and have been biking (or running) all off season since April,  you want to start with a strong upper body for all your great poling technique. 

4. I need to work the core. More than just sit-ups,  I think of all exercises that strengthen all sides of my core box where all my moving muscles are connected. 

5. I am planning my early ski vacation to Mt. Bachelor in late November and the Methow Valley in early December.  I will be teaching for the fourth time at the Methow Valley Ski Camp.  It is moved even later to the last long weekend before Christmas: December 19th to Sunday the 22nd.

6. Finally I plan continuing my education with PSIA (Professional Ski Instructors of America) Instructors courses.

If you want a tune-up lesson or two, my website: Schreckski.com 

is up and updated for this season.  After experimenting last March, I increased private lessons by 25% to 75 minutes. Group lessons are now two hours for better quality of your XC ski lessons. Because I sold out my weekends before the skiing even started last season, if you need a weekend time-slot,  now is a good time to make your request. In the event that two individuals want the same time and date, Venmo receipt reserves it. Please note the new days for each SnoPark. Hyak is for beginning skiers.   Crystal Springs is for intermediate to advanced XC skiers.  As always,  if you purchase 3 weeks of lessons, the 4th lesson is on me!

So let's bike now that we can't XC ski!
