Hi ski friends, 

I am taking a break from skiing on the I-90 Corridor and heading up to teach for three days up in the Methow.  I am picking up skis for two of my skier friends. 

 If you need new skis or poles , Winthrop Mountain Sports has a great selection (before or in anticipation of the skiers arriving for the Methow Valley Ski Camp this long weekend) of skis boots and poles when i skied up there beforeThanksgiving. 

If you need anything,  call them, purchase and let me know when they are ready for pick-up and I will bring them to you at our next lesson or ski session! I can hot wax them if you like. 

I tried my old teaching Fischer Crown skis while teaching yesterday.  Thanks to Susan for her questions about the new skin skis for faster Classic skiing. Here's my advice:

Hi Susan, 
Yes permanent short skins are just for classic skiing.  They have been a game changer for me because they work in hard really bad Icy conditions or cold powder on ice when fish scales don't. I love them.

 I think today on fishscales was interesting.   I  had three classic lessons today and my skin skis were waxed along with your Rossignol skis this morning and all are in the hotbox. So I pulled out my Fischer Crown classic skis.  Fine for teaching but not fast when I free skied!

Two options for purchase. 
1. See if REI.com  or GearWest.com online have skin skis. Match to your current weight.

2. Call Winthrop Mountain Sports and see if they have a skin ski in your price range. Pay for it and tell them i am teaching up at the Methow Valley Ski Camp this weekend (I drive up tomorrow to ski before i teach). Let me know when they are ready with wax off and I'll pick them up for you and being to our Monday morning lesson.  I am also doing this for another of my students (your full service ski instructor!) who is really light and couldn't find skin skis that fit anywhere but up there.

let's bike if we can't ski!
