Hi XC skiers,

 This article just posted in Cross Country Skier magazine December 22nd. It discusses taking XC Skate or Classic lessons and why finding a certified instructor may improve your experience.

 I have taught XC skiing (once known as Nordic) full-time since 2013 and joined PSIA for the coaching on how to teach XC Skate and Classic technique effectively.  In 2014, I passed my PSIA Level 1 exams.  In 2016, I passed my Level 2 exams, a full two day on snow skiing test on teaching intermediate Classic and Skate students how to ski more efficiently and effortlessly!

 This month, before I taught 3 full days at the largest XC Ski Camp in the NW, (the Methow Valley Ski Camp) I practiced at an advanced level ski clinic led by the PSIA National Coach, Tulie.  So I believe XC ski instruction is so helpful for me to get the most enjoyment out of XC skiing and teaching. I love teaching and am passionate about transferring my skills to my students. 

 I hope you enjoy YOUR XC Skiing journey!

let's bike if we can't ski!
