Hi Skiers,

If you have all your ski gear then you can skip this!

One of my students asked me today where is the best (and where not to go) places to get their XC ski equipment.  Here's my response:

"So here's my recommendation for finding your new skate ski equipment from #1 and 2 and also #3 and 4 which I do not recommend:

1. Ideally, if you can get there, is Winthrop Mountain Sports in the Methow Valley. I know it's a long ways away so you want to combine it with a ski vacation but they sell more quality medium to high end racing XC ski equipment than just about anyone in the West; and upstairs is their ski attic for demo, rental and last years ski deals. The Bjornsen couple who own it are former World Cup XC ski racers and I get all my equipment from them. Tell them Schreck sent you!

2. If you need a Seattle area location, REI Seattle or REI Bellevue are OK choices for basic beginner To intermediate setups for XC Skiing. Ask for the most knowledgeable XC ski employee on site. You don't want someone who is a snowboarder setting you up!

3. Newport High has a big Fall ski swap every year. The XC selection in the past is poor and buyer beware.

4. Tread the internet with care. Fit is everything so you must try the boots on and make sure the ski flex is right for your total ski weight (unless you ski naked, include your entire kit, boots and pack to determine ski flex).

If you want me to teach you how to ski more efficiently and effortlessly, I would love to help! My website:

So if we can't ski,
let's bike,
