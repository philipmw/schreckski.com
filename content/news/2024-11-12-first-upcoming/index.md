Hi returning and new students, 

For returning students,  you know the drill. The more I know about your ski goals, ski strengths, your talents from other sports and how you like to learn, the better it will help me create a positive impact for you on your next ski lesson with me.  And we will build on that first lesson for your next lessons.

 For new students,  I ask that you trust that I can help you like I have for all my other students in this, my 12th season teaching full-time!

My goal is to teach you the way you want to be taught, to help you love the winter outdoors especially on your XC skis!  So even for my returning students and especially for the lucky few, new to me, beginning/intermediate skiers, answering these questions will help me prepare for your private or duo lessons,  especially the first one of the season.  Just reply back and fill in the blanks below before our first session. Thanks!
-------------------------------------------
Preferred Name (mine's Schreck!):
They/she/he:

Now  tell me a little about your experience skiing; both Skate/Classic Skiing and/or Alpine/Downhill/BC, that would help me prepare for your first lesson of the season:

 How many years have you Classic/Skate skied?:
 How many times a year on average?:

If you've taken Classic/Skate XC ski lessons before, where and how long?:

If yes, What was easy for you to do on skis?:
 What was hard for you to do on skis?:

What is your favorite sport or activity when you can't XC ski?: 

Finally, If you know how you learn best, that helps me emphasize THIS during your lesson and my instruction; so do you learn best listening (auditory learner), seeing (visual) or doing while observing (kinesthetic.)?:

Any injuries I need to be aware of?:

You can reply on this questionnaire!
---------------------------------------------
Hopefully, before your lessons, you can get outside to work on your balance,  cardio, and especially your core. If not, there's lots of indoor activities that help. Getting on snow is a bonus!

Some ideas:
Watch my YouTube videos.  There's a link to all of the instructional videos for both Classic and Skate technique on my website Schreckski.com.  
Try watching a topic that interests you on a bigger screen while you "ski" in your socks in your home.  Work especially on going from one "ski sock" to the other.  If you feel foolish, get your friend or family to join you!

Your core is your key to proper form. All your ski muscles attach to this strong "box": ðŸ’ª ðŸ¦µand your upper back muscles.  A weak core makes it hard to execute the fundamental movements.  So some excellent exercises are any core crunch, core stiffen,  lower back and oblique muscles on your sides.  If you can feel the "top of the box", your diaphragm and your "bottom of the box", your pelvic girdle/pelvic diaphragm,  you are getting prepared!

Finally, If this all too much for your busy schedule then promise me you will do just this one thing that takes no additional time:

When you brush your teeth and when you dry yourself off after your shower, do both moving from one foot, balance briefly and then move to the other foot. Trust me, it will help your balance and you will ski so much better!

So let's run, bike, Rollerski, ski bounding, SUP, and work that core until we can XC ski!
