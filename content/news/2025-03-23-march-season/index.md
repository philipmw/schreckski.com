Hi Skiers,

We have 9 more groomed ski days before we have to travel to Mt. Bachelor Nordic Center to find grooming this season.  Washington XC ski grooming ends March 31st. 

The Summit at Snoqualmie says that there currently is a 77" base with 230" to date of snowfall. 4" in last 48 hours. That's impressive üëè for March!

WA DOT is a bit more conservative.  But our base has grown,  not shrunk in March. They record 53" of new snowfall in last two weeks going from a 55" base to a more healthy 72" base. That is 6 feet of compacted snow. Backcountry skiing should extend well into April once the Avalanche Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è subsides. The Mt. Catherine Loop will be beautiful then.

For those of you skiing still, you know that a chance of rain at the Pass has meant snow or patchy clouds at Crystal Springs. The grooming is excellent early in the day but gets chewed up later in the day by lots of skiers on the weekends and the sun if it comes out on the Weekdays. So the best skiing window is just after the groomer comes through around 8am until about noon.

If you are done skiing until next season please hot wax your skis and leave the wax on all Summer to protect your bases. Condition your fixed skins if you have them on your classic skis. 

If you wish to work on technique here's my last open slots for a private 75 minute lesson this season:

Monday. 8am either skate or Classic 
Wednesday 8am and 11am Skate is best
Thursday 8am and 9:30 Classic is option
Friday 9:30 and 11am Skate is best
Sunday 8am skate only
31st 8am and 11am either

My website Schreckski.com

I hope to see you skiing or biking soon! I will be leading Roslyn Gravel Riders Saturday gravel bike rides starting in April.  Let me know if you're interested.  We start out doing shorter flatter rides in April to stay below the snow line and to adjust to the saddle. We have a "no drop" and "stop for snacks" policy. Usually wheels up at the Rise Roslyn Bike Shop at 9 am on Saturdays.  If you want to ride with me on any other day of the week, my cellphone number is 425 802 6699. 

So let's XC Ski until we bike!
