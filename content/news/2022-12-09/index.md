Hi "sore" XC Skiers,,

Thanks to Blaine for asking how to recover from all this new skiing he is doing!

I KNOW, I am a little sore too having skied like everyday, all day since grooming started back in November...
Yesterday I was skiing with OTM on rough ungroomed for a week at the local golf course because well the Pass was closed and I gotta get my ski on. Hit a Fir cone (or snow snake, not sure) and hit the firm hard crust hard. So yeh I can relate with you and your aches and pains.

We need to take care of our bodies once we ramp up the length and/or intensity (I am not your doctor so see her if you are in pain) by XC skiing even if we are in fit aerobic shape from biking, running or whatever Summer sport is your thing.

You are a study with a N of 1, so what works for me may or may not work for you.

Here's what works for me when I switch from biking everyday to XC skiing everyday:

Warm-up and stretch at home before driving up. It's tough to do in a blizzard. That said,  ask me at our next lesson to go through a quick 3 minutes "on skis" stretch that works for me if you're interested. 

If a muscle or part of your body is sore in the morning,  take care of it:
  Roll, massage, heat and stretch that particular area slowly üêå üëå 

  Drink to thirst, salt to taste. Don't be unbalanced. 

If it's sore after skiing...

Repeat after skiing. Take a nap. You earned it!

This has worked for me.  Results may vary. Listen to your body.

See you at your next lesson!

let's bike if we can't ski!
