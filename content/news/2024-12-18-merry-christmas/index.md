Hi Skiers,

Merry Christmas and a happy New XC SKI Year!

"It's looking a lot like Christmas!" up here in the Snoqualmie Pass Corridor.  We should be skiing right after Christmas. I want to thank all of you for choosing me, Schreck, to teach you. 🙏 

Speaking of which, if you have a family member interested in learning or just trying out XC classic skiing with a lesson or you have a spouse who is an expert XC skate skier who might like a tune-up lesson, you can certainly be Kris Kringle and gift them a lesson or more.  Just let me know what you want the gift lesson to be:

 A single private lesson for 75 minutes is $110 for one person.  Or you can join them for $160 total.
If they have been good, a two hour private lesson for one is $160. For two skiers, it's $210.

You can include a ski hat (or maybe new boots!) and they can choose their preferred day of the week after they open your card on Christmas. 

Merry Christmas 🎅 🎄 from Schreck 

So let's bike now that we can't XC ski!
