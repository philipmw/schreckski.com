Hi Skiers,

What a week of incredible XC skiing up here! New snow, cold nights, bluebird days. Perfect Spring Skiing. Bring your sunglasses ðŸŒž ðŸ•¶ ðŸ˜Ž 

NOAA Saturday Snoqualmie Pass forecast: 36Â° F low going to a high of 55! No Wind, Bluebird skies for your skis!

With the great bluebird skiing conditions, this brings a lot more skiers than usual for March so plan accordingly ðŸ˜‰ 

At Crystal Springs SnoPark,  we meet up at the intersection of the P2C Trail and The Stampede Pass Trail going up from our Lot #1, Non-motorized: 

March 16th Saturday Crystal Springs Sno Park: 

8:30: Christina, 2nd skate lesson 

10:00 am: Marissa and husband,  2nd Skate Lesson 

11:30: Vita, 8th Classic lesson 

1:30:  Philip, Tatiana etc., Skate up top at Summit East 

I look forward to seeing you!
