Hi XC skiers,

Thanks for a great season and allowing me to help you ski better this season. I taught over 75 new and beginning skate and classic skiers this season and hopefully you are excited to continue next season in this great winter sport.

So Rollerskiing, Rollerskating,  Rollerblading or ski bounding season (all with poles) is upon us. If you need help with anything, please let me know. I have a safe flat newly laid asphalt nearby if you need it. I am happy to help if you're new to Rollerskiing. 

With all this new snow and cold weather, ü•∂ üò© some have asked me if they can still XC ski in late April or May on snow? There are two local options and one expensive vacation option:

1. If you have wider classic skis, the Cold Creek trail and Mt Catherine loop is usually groomed by other skiers with a fairly decent track. üòâ hint, sometimes the groomer heads out to groom! No way to know but we keep checking! I have really enjoyed the loop as lots of snow and great base especially on top. Lots of climbing though ü§î 

2. The Kongsberger Club has been occasionally pulling a classic track groomer behind a snowmobile at Cabin Creek Sno Park on the Viking, Berg and Road trails. Classic only and no way to know when a volunteer will groom (Maybe after a snow storm?) The snow base is excellent.  Don't be surprised that the first 50 yards is a sh##storm. Walk past it to see better tracks and cleaner snow.

Vacation option: 
So the best 7 days a week groomed 54 KM on snow ski option is Mt Bachelor Nordic Center. I know, you're thinking it's at least 5 hours away.  The best and closest to skiing lodging is Loge Camps and they are about 25 mi minutesfrom the Nordic Lodge. Tell Schreck sent you and ask for the Spring special price.  Logecamps.com 

If you want a lesson from them, contact the Mt Bachelor Nordic Center.  If you want to ski tour with me,  I'll be back April 27th through May 3rd. No charge but if you find my tips helpful, then I appreciate üôè your tips!
I just returned from Mt Bachelor.  They received over 45 inches of cold packed pow while I was there and a couple photos from that trip are below for your viewing pleasure! ‚õ∑ 

Otherwise, remember to keep up your balance drills, get outside as much as possible to rollerski, bike, run, paddle or whatever rocks your boat!

I hope to see you out skiing next winter! I also hope to have my daughter Annie videotape some more YouTube videos on my next trip to Mt Bachelor.  And you can connect to my channel on YouTube through my Website: Schreckski.com

let's bike if we can't ski!
