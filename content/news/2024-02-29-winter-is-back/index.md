Hi XC skiers, 

Have you seen how much snow has dumped up here? 2 feet already at Hyak.  About 18 inches at Crystal Springs SnoPark.  
The forecast is for a lot more. It feels like the middle of winter, not Spring yet. We should have excellent grooming for March.

All private and couples tune-up lessons in March are now 25% longer: 75 minutes for the one hour price. 2 1/2 hours for the price of two!

If you are interested,  this gives us More time to work on your technique areas that slow you down. 

My website:
 Schreckski.com 
has more information about this and a link to my Venmo account to reserve now before your favorite day of the week is filled.

Heres the current slots available for Fridays,  Saturdays and Mondays in March:
1st. Full
2nd Full
4th Full 
8th Full 
9th 8:30 (Sat!)
11th 8:30
15th 8:30 & 10am 
16th 11:30
18th 10am 
22nd 10am 
23rd 8:30 & 10am 
25 10am 
29th 10am 
30th 8:30 & 10am 

I hope to see you out skiing soon! 

So let's XC SKI if we can't bike!
