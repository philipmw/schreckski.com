Hi Skiers,

If you're already moved on to golf or gardening,  you can delete.  Let me know and no more updates.

#1 question is about weather, snow and grooming. So here's my answer.

Great to hear from you! The base is enough to probably groom until April 1st (March 31st, just before midnight to be precise). 

We got 18 inches in 48 hours earlier this week. Its snowing now. The groomers are doing an awesome job considering so much snow Falling fast.  Yes, the parking lots and grooming was difficult Monday  and Tuesday.  But it was a blizzard and they take Tuesday off from grooming!

Some things to think about when skiing in Spring:

1. Start bringing sunscreen and sunglasses!
2. Keep your chains in your trunk and snow tires on until May 1st. You may have to take off Studded snow tires earlier depending on weather in your county. 
3. Sun up now for 7:30 am skiing if you're an early bird or need to get some work done later in day. I am here usually at Crystal Springs if you want to ski with me at 7:30 or need an early lesson. 
4. If you hot wax, Wax for the midnight temperatures! I can hot wax, hot box, structure, etc., your skis and clean and prep your classic skins. Justleave em with me and I will bring them up when you next ski at Crystal Springs. 
5. If you need to schedule a lesson, all lessons at Crystal Springs Sno Park unless noted.  So here's some options:

February 
20th 10am 
21st. 10am (classic only)
23rd  8:30
24th  10am 
25th 12:45 (Sat. for rescheduled weekend lessons only please)
27th 8:30 &11:00 @ Hyak Sno Park.  (Beginning students as flat)
March 
1st  10am 
2nd  8:30 &11:30
3rd   8:30 &10:00
6th.  8:30 &11:00 Hyak SnoPark  (beginning skiers as rail trail flat!)
