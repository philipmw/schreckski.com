  Number 1 and 2 Questions I get from my fellow XC skiers
</h2>



</div>

<div id="newsletter-content" class="read">
<p>Hi XC Skiers,</p>
<p>First, the number 2 Question is &quot;Schreck, Where do you think is the best place to get/upgrade my XC equipment?&quot;</p>
<p>No, it's no longer REI unless you want beginning skier equipment and know how to fit yourself.  I personally get all my skate and classic skis, boots, poles and clothing from Marine and Eric Bjornsen at Winthrop Mountain Sports in Winthrop.  If you are a racer or need your skis stone ground, Mark at Ultratune is an excellent choice and has only racing skis.  He's also in Winthrop.
If you are skiiing at Mt Bachelor,  Webb Skis in Bend has excellent ski techs to get you the right fit. And no sales tax!
Why Winthrop Mountain Sports for me? The owners are retired World Cup Ski racers; they have the best selection; and they know what they are doing in fitting you.  If you can't make a vacation trip to the Methow Valley (and you owe it to yourself to take at least one trip there a season!) They will schedule a Zoom appointment for you.
Also, this season,  they have their own custom poles, &quot;Bjorn First&quot;; made in the USA.  I have tried them and love them! Two price and weight levels: a 50% carbon fiber and for racing, and a 100% ultralight carbon fiber quiver if you want the lightest poles!</p>
<p>And the number 1 Question is &quot;Schreck, Where do you think is the best place to ski today/tomorrow/Saturday?&quot;</p>
<p>You can classic ski most everyday everywhere (that is groomed for our type of skiing) as the mechanical tracks hold up pretty well even after a few days of no grooming as long as it's not dumping snow). Fresh grooming is imperative for skate skiing though. Here's my experience:</p>
<p>First, Don't go by previous year's ski experience.  Grooming budgets are much better this year so overall,  there's more kilometers groomed!  Here's where to go if you ski on-the-fly in the Snoqualmie Pass area:</p>
<p>Monday:
I teach beginning skiers at Hyak SnoPark on the P2C.  It is usually quiet and is groomed by 8 am when the gate opens.
Cabin has the lower trails (12 k including The Road, Viking,  Berg and sometimes Ozbaldy) groomed usually at daybreak for worker bees who need to get back to the office early.</p>
<p>Tuesday:
P2C Trail (unless avy danger)
Cabin lower trails (unless they don't; always check the Cabin website before going.
<a href="https://www.kongsbergers.org/GroomingReport">https://www.kongsbergers.org/GroomingReport</a>  )
Most skiers take the day off as we used to never get any grooming on Tuesdays!
8 am at Hyak or 9 am at Crystal Springs SnoParks to reach the P2C.
Tuesday is my day off from teaching so; If you want to free ski with me,  let me know. I usually start skate skiing at daybreak at Cabin Creek to get first tracks.</p>
<p>Wednesday:
Best day if you only ski one day a week! Yeah! The most groomed kilometers is Wednesday for green and blue trails. Only weekday that Trollhaugen and sled dog trails are fully groomed; and with light crowds, the trails hold up well. Go to Hyak, Crystal Springs or Cabin Creek Sno Parks. I teach intermediate/advanced skiers at Crystal Springs.</p>
<p>Thursday:
Calling all climbers! Only weekday for getting grooming to the top of Mt Amabilis!  Lower Cabin Creek and the P2C and sled dog trails (also great for skate skiers) are all groomed as well. With light crowds, an excellent ski day. I teach intermediate/advanced skiers at Crystal Springs.</p>
<p>Friday:
Friday is the new Saturday for XC skiers.  Expect crowds so be early!
All the usual lower trails groomed at Cabin. No Amabilis or Trollhaugen.
I teach beginning/intermediate skiers techniques for going faster at Hyak.</p>
<p>Saturdays:
Parking is an issue due to Big increase in number of us XC skiers dog sleds.  Biggest lot ( if you are not an early bird) and best skiing is probably Crystal Springs SnoPark.  If you start by 8:30, you can ski anywhere.  Only day (besides Thursday) that the Mt  Amabilis loop is groomed. Lower Trails at Cabin Creek are busy with the students with Momentum ski school kids and their families.
Lots of sled dog and skijoring traffic on their trails so not ideal for us XC skating skiers. Be patient and nice. Lots of new to Nordic fellow XC skiers and skijoring skiers out there! Also, Trollhaugen is groomed for the blind and guide skiers so 4 mechanical tracks. Great for for classic but too narrow for skate skiing
I try to teach XC skiers who only have weekends off on the P2C. Not ideal for beginning XC skiers.</p>
<p>Sunday:
Still crowded like Saturday.  Eburg ski group at Cabin Creek.  REI beginner lessons at Crystal Springs. Trollhaugen and the top of Mt Amabilis are NOT groomed!
Hoards of sledders at Hyak. Pick your poison and get up early if you want a parking spot and good grooming! I have my make up and rescheduled lessons at Crystal Springs. Then I get to free ski or fat tire bike!</p>
<p>I have availability on Wednesdays and Thursdays in February and the other days open in March if you want a tune-up lesson this season. Email me your preferred dates.</p>
<p>Here's my Website <a href="https://schreckski.com">https://schreckski.com</a></p>
<p>If you want to try something else that's a longer drive/multi day trip, and there's enough snow, Lake Easton SP SnoPark and Suncadia Ski Trails are groomed every day it snows and there's enough snowpack. For a fun out of the way vacation,  my first pick is the Methow Valley,  2nd Plain, and 3rd, Leavenworth ski trails.</p>
<p>So let's XC SKI if we can't bike!</p>
