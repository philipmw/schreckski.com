<p>Hi XC skiers,</p>
<p>One of the most often asked question I get is when can I start skiing? Well it was just announced this morning that the Methow Valley Ski Camp (MVSC) sign up dates are in about a week!  (See below for sign up details from them).</p>
<p>For those who are interested here's the details on the Ski Camp. This will be my 4 year teaching.  Before I was an instructor (13 years ago), I loved going to this camp!</p>
<p>Here's my take on the MVSC:
Three full days of on snow group XC ski lessons with an experienced PSIA XC (Professional Ski Instructors of America Cross Country) certified instructor (maybe me!) at Sun Mountain Lodge.  Ski in/ski out, great breakfasts and lunch included at the Lodge. On your own for dinner and lodging.  Small groups of 6-8 self selected skiers of similar abilities and energy levels and your instructor ski out all morning and afternoon with a long lunch break. Warning,  there will be drills but you will learn the PSIA fundamentals from one of the 24 great instructors and be ready for a great XC ski season.</p>
<p>Afterwards, there's Group Stretching, interesting evening talks on our sport, or just hang out in the pool size jacuzzi or the bar at the lodge.</p>
<p>One benefit at Camp is the Swix National Sales Rep, Jack, sets up the pool üé± room into a huge waxing room.  He sets out the right waxes for the conditions that day, has all the tools and resources you need to hot wax your skis. There's someone to help you if it's your first time working with a ski iron!</p>
<p>Also, all major XC brands (Fischer, Salomon, Atomic, Madshus, and Rossignol,)  are usually there for you to demo the latest, newest skis and boots. It's a great way to find the perfect fit in boots and see which ski feels right for you! The local Winthrop Mountain Sports carries a huge selection of everything you need for cross country skiing and they give a good discount during that weekend to campers (MVSC skiers). Please tell them Schreck sent you!</p>
<p>And it's a chance to meet and have fun with a lot of very excited skiers and instructors. I hope to see you there!
Schedule:
Dates for MVS Camp are December 19th-22nd:
Thursday afternoon,  registration (lots of us also get there early to ski the fresh grooming)
Friday: All day lessons, usually skate. If you've never skated, there's a beginner class on a very nice beginner area! The ski shop at the lodge can rent you everything you need.  Get your gear on Thursday.
Saturday: All day lessons, usually Classic.  If you only skate, there's a group for &quot;only skaters&quot;.
Sunday: All day ski with your favorite instructor. Skate and Classic classes are offered.</p>
<p>Here's the dates to register. Remember, it sells out on the second date, sometimes in an hour. So either join their group to leisure sign up on the first day or be quick when registration opens on the second morning.  You were warned!  Here's their email:</p>
<hr>
<p>Ski Camp!
Our oh so popular Ski camp opens registration on October 7th to members, and October 8 for everyone else. As you may know, this fills extremely quickly, so join or renew your membership today!</p>
<p><a href="https://methowvalleynordic.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=62bfe9ee0aac9031ce759a139&amp;id=a1642d6007&amp;e=e3c0df79a8">https://methowvalleynordic.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=62bfe9ee0aac9031ce759a139&amp;id=a1642d6007&amp;e=e3c0df79a8</a></p>
<p>‚Äê---------------------------</p>
<p>Also, my website Schreckski.com  is updated for this season and has everything you need if you want to reserve your Skate or Classic XC ski lessons in January.</p>
<p>Based on NOAA winter forecast, I am also optimistic we may ski in mid/late  December.  If groomed, here's the dates open for an early private lesson or two with me:</p>
<p>December open dates:
14th,  15th,  16th
23rd
26th,  27th,  28th
29th, 30th,  31st</p>
<p>January is filling up fast so if you need specific dates or  day of the week, then now is a good time to reserve your preferred slot. As always, sign up for three XC ski lessons and the 4th lesson is on me.  Note that all private lessons are either 75 minutes (25% longer) or two hours. Your choice.</p>
<p>So let's bike now that we can't XC ski!</p>
